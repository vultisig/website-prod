      <p>THESE TERMS CONSTITUTE A LEGALLY BINDING AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU AND US. PLEASE READ THESE TERMS CAREFULLY TO ENSURE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE TO EVERY PORTION OF THESE TERMS BEFORE USING ANY PART OF THE SERVICE. Vultisig PROVIDES SOFTWARE TO INTERACT WITH MULTIPLE BLOCKCHAINS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ETHEREUM, BINANCE SMART CHAIN, AND SOLANA. THESE BLOCKCHAINS ARE OPERATED BY THIRD PARTIES.</p>

      <p>These terms of service (these “Terms” or the “Terms”) issued by Cortina Ventures Pty Ltd, 46 Singlefin Crescent, Bokarina, Queensland, Australia 4575 (“Vultisig”, “we”, “our”, or “us”) govern your use or access of: (1) vultisig.com and any other website maintained or published by Vultisig (each, a “Website”); (2) our mobile application, which allows access to the various blockchains from a mobile device (“App”); provided on or in connection with our service enabling you to interact with the blockchains (the Websites, the App, collectively, the “Service”). By accessing or using any part of the Service you acknowledge that you have read, understood, acknowledge, and agree to be bound by these Terms in full. These Terms apply to any visitor of a Website, user of the Service, and any other person who otherwise accesses or uses the Service (each a “User”). Certain parts of the Service may be subject to additional terms that we may specify from time to time, and your use of such Service is subject to those additional terms. Such additional terms are hereby incorporated into these Terms.</p>
      <p>Vultisig may, in its sole discretion, modify or update these Terms from time to time, so you should review this page periodically. When we change these Terms in a material manner, we will update the date at the top of this page and inform the User timely in advance by an adequate notice of such changes in the App and on the Website. If you do not agree to any such changes, , you are entitled to stop using the Service at any time prior to their entry into force. Your continued use of the Services after the changes entered into force constitutes your acceptance such the changes</p>
      <p>INVESTMENT DISCLAIMER: Vultisig does not endorse or recommend any particular digital asset, transaction, or purchasing strategy. Content on any of the Websites or your communications with any of our personnel should not be construed as purchase or investment advice. You should seek independent advice prior to using the Service. You acknowledge and represent that all transaction decisions made in connection with your use of the Service are made solely by you and Vultisig will have no liability for any of your decisions. THE RISK OF LOSS IN BUYING OR SELLING A DIGITAL ASSET CAN BE SUBSTANTIAL, THEREFORE YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER WHETHER BUYING OR SELLING A DIGITAL ASSET IS SUITABLE FOR YOU IN LIGHT OF YOUR FINANCIAL CONDITION BEFORE BUYING OR SELLING A DIGITAL ASSET.</p>

      <ol type="i" className="Use-of-the-Service">
        <li>Use of the Service
          <ol type="a">
            <li>Eligibility to use the Service. You shall not use the Service unless you are in full compliance with these Terms and all applicable laws. You shall not use any part of this Service if you lack legal capacity to act in relation to Vultisig. If you are entering into these Terms for an entity, such as the company you work for, you represent to us that you have legal authority to bind that entity. Any use of access to the Service by anyone under 18 is prohibited. Currently, we do not allow Users residing or present in the following jurisdictions to use the Service: Afghanistan, Burundi, Central African Republic, Crimea Region of Ukraine, Cuba, Democratic Republic of Congo, Eritrea, Guinea, Republic of Guinea-Bissau, Haiti, Iran,Iraq, Lebanon, Libya, Mali, Myanmar, Nicaragua, Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, Pakistan, Somalia, Sudan, South Sudan, Syria, Venezuela, Yemen, Zimbabwe or any other state, country or region that is included in the Sanctions Lists, any jurisdiction sanctioned by the United States Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control or any jurisdiction sanctioned by Australia (in particular by the UN Security Council), or any other jurisdiction we determine to present a high risk of fraud.  You shall not use the Service if you reside or are present in one of the jurisdictions in the previous sentence.<br /><br /></li>
            <li>The Service Generally. Generally, the purpose of the Service is to allow Users to hold and interact with various blockchains. OUR SERVICE IS NON-CUSTODIAL AND BASED ON THIRD-PARTY BLOCKCHAINS, MEANING Vultisig NEVER TAKES CONTROL OF THE DIGITAL ASSETS THAT INTERACT WITH OUR SERVICE OR OF THE BLOCKCHAINS GOVERNING THE TRANSACTION. THE TRANSACTION IS BETWEEN YOU AND THE RESPECTIVE BLOCKCHAIN AND GOVERNED BY THE TERMS OF THAT BLOCKCHAIN. You may be charged a miner or network fee by the respective blockchain to process the Transaction on your behalf (a “Miner Fee”). The Miner Fee applicable to your Transaction is shown to you before your authorization of the Transaction. Vultisig may modify or update any portion of the Service at any time. Subject to your full compliance with these Terms, you are hereby granted a non-exclusive, limited, non-transferable, freely revocable license to access and use the Service for entrepreneurial or business use only (as opposed to a use for personal, social, family, household, and similar needs) and as permitted by the features of the Service, at and during the time of your access or use of the Service (“Service License”). You shall not use any part of the Service for illegal or fraudulent purposes or for the purpose of consummating Transactions on behalf of another person. For the avoidance of doubt, you must be the beneficial owner of the digital assets, the sending address, and the destination address. Vultisig reserves all rights not expressly granted in these Terms in the Service and the Vultisig Content (as defined below). Vultisig may revoke the Service License or any portion of the Service at any time for any or no reason. For the avoidance of doubt, you may stop using our Services at any time for any or no reason.</li>
            <li>Suspension or Termination of the Service. You acknowledge that we may, without prior notice to you: suspend the Service; change the Service; stop providing the Service or features of the Service, to you or to Users generally; or create usage or Transaction limits on the Service. In particular, we may suspend, change or stop providing the Service in response to changed regulatory requirements or in case you used the Service in reasonably suspected or actual violation of these Terms. For the avoidance of doubt, you may stop using our Services at any time for any or no reason.<br /><br /></li>
            <li>Third-Party Integrations. Our interface may include integrations, links, or other access to third-party services, websites, technology, content, and resources (each a “Third-Party Service”). Your access and use of the Third-Party Services may also be subject to additional terms and conditions, privacy policies, or other agreements with such third parties. You may be required to authenticate to or create separate accounts to use Third-Party Services on the websites or via the technology platforms of their respective providers. You, and not Vultisig, will be responsible for any and all costs and charges associated with your use of any Third-Party Services. Vultisig enables these Third-Party Services solely as a convenience, and the integration or inclusion of such Third-Party Services does not imply an endorsement or recommendation. Any dealings you have with third parties while using our products are between you and the third party. Vultisig disclaims all liability in connection with any actions or omissions of third parties, and will not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with the use of or reliance on any Third-Party Services.<br /><br /><p>Disclaimer of Warranties. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE SERVICE IS BEING PROVIDED BY Vultisig “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS AND FOR FREE. Vultisig MAKES NO WARRANTY REGARDING THE SERVICE OR THE APP AND HEREBY EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL EXPRESS, IMPLIED AND/OR STATUTORY WARRANTIES AND/OR GUARANTEE, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD-PARTY RIGHTS. Vultisig DOES IN PARTICULAR NOT WARRANT AND/OR GUARANTEE THAT: THE SERVICE WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS OR EXPECTATIONS; THE SERVICE WILL BE AVAILABLE UNINTERRUPTED OR AVAILABLE AT ANY PARTICULAR TIME OR LOCATION,</p><p>SECURE, OR ERROR-FREE; ANY CONTENT PROVIDED TO YOU IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICE WILL BE ACCURATE, RELIABLE, OR CORRECT; ANY OF THE SERVICE'S DEFECTS OR ERRORS WILL BE CORRECTED; OR THAT THE SERVICE WILL BE FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS. NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM Vultisig OR THROUGH THE SERVICE WILL CREATE ANY WARRANTY.</p><p>Any content downloaded or otherwise obtained through the use of the Service is downloaded at your own risk and you will be solely responsible for any damage to your computer system or mobile device or loss of data that results from such download or your use of the Service.</p><p>Due to the disclaimers in this section, we strongly recommend that you only use the App to manage, buy, sell, or trade small amounts of digital assets. If any issues arise in connection with the Service, Vultisig shall make reasonable efforts to resolve such issues, but you acknowledge that Vultisig will have no liability for any bugs, errors, or other problems that result in loss of your funds or digital assets. You acknowledge that the Service may contain more or fewer features or be licensed under different terms than previous versions.</p><p>The disclaimers and exclusions under these Terms will not apply to the extent prohibited by applicable law. Certain laws and jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion and limitations of certain warranties, so the exclusions in this section may not apply to you. These Terms give you specific legal rights, and you may also have other rights which vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.</p><p>Prohibited Export No portion of the Service may be exported or re-exported to certain countries or those persons or entities prohibited from receiving exports from the USA and/or Australia.<br /><br /></p>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Blockchain Network Transactions
          <ol type="a">
            <li>Digital Wallet. You may be required to create or link with the Service a digital wallet in order to utilize certain aspects of the service, including initiating and completing Blockchain Networks Transactions. WHEN YOU CREATE A NEW DIGITAL WALLET, YOU MUST BACK UP ALL YOUR VAULT SHARES TO RETAIN ACCESS TO ANY DIGITAL ASSETS STORED IN SUCH WALLET. THIS IS NECESSARY TO RETAIN OR RECOVER ANY APPLICABLE DIGITAL ASSETS IF YOU DELETE THE Vultisig APP OR IF Vultisig CEASES OPERATION.  You are solely responsible for the management of any digital wallet you control and the digital assets within such digital wallet.  Vultisig may not be able to recover any digital wallet or digital asset for you in the event you lose your vault shares.  You acknowledge that Vultisig will not be liable for any loss of funds or digital assets due to your loss of your vault shares.<br /><br /></li>
            <li>In order to be completed, all network transactions with cryptocurrency, digital tokens or digital assets ("virtual currency") must be confirmed and recorded in the associated public blockchain. Such networks are decentralized, peer-to-peer networks supported by independent third parties, which we do not own, control, or operate. Vultisig has no control over the Blockchain Networks and, therefore, cannot and do not ensure that any transaction details that you submit via the Interface will be confirmed and processed. By using the Interface, you acknowledge and agree that the transaction details you submit may not be completed, or may be substantially delayed, by the Blockchain Networks. You understand and accept that digital assets present market volatility risk, technical software risks, regulatory risks, and cybersecurity risks. You understand that the cost and speed of a blockchain-based system is variable, that cost may increase dramatically at any time, and that cost and speed is not within the capability of our control.<br /></li>
            <li>Vultisig does not store, transfer, transmit, convert, broker, hold, escrow, mint, mine, or otherwise interact with any virtual currency, security, financial instrument, or other digital or physical asset and all the interactions are performed on the third-party protocols, subject to any associated third-party terms. Any transfer that occurs in any virtual currency occurs on the Blockchain Network and not on a network owned by Vultisig. Vultisig therefore does not guarantee that we can affect the transfer of title or right in any virtual Currency. You accept and acknowledge that Vultisig is not responsible for any errors or omissions that you make in connection with any virtual currency transaction initiated via the Interface. Vultisig strongly encourages you to review your transaction details carefully before attempting to transfer a virtual currency.<br /></li>
            <li>Completion of transactions that you instruct for through the Interface also depends on the availability and operation of the Blockchain Networks. Errors or forks in the Blockchain Networks may cause transactions that you initiate through the Interface to fail. This may mean that the transaction you were originally intending to perform will no longer be available. Unfortunately, due to the decentralized nature of the Blockchain Networks, there is no one single point of failure, and so neither Vultisig nor any particular party will be responsible to you for errors or any losses that you suffer as a result.<br /></li>
            <li>Underlying Protocols. Generally, the underlying protocols in our Service are open source and any person can use, copy, modify, and distribute them. You acknowledge that: (i) Vultisig does not own or control the underlying software protocols which govern the operation of the digital assets supported on the Service; (ii) that Vultisig is not responsible for the operation of the underlying protocols and that we make no warranty and/or guarantee of those protocols’ functionality, security, or availability; and (iii) that the underlying protocols are subject to sudden changes in operating rules, which may materially affect the value, function, our ability to have a particular digital asset listed on our Service, the name of the digital asset, or any combination of the foregoing items.<br /></li>
            <li>Digital Asset Forks. In the event of a digital asset fork, you acknowledge that: (i) Vultisig may, without advance notice to you temporarily suspend operations associated with such digital asset; (ii) Vultisig may not support either branch of the forked digital asset protocol after that fork; (iii) if you send a Transaction at the time of the fork, only the originally-intended Transaction that you sent is honored; and (iv) Vultisig assumes no responsibility for damages related to an unsupported branch of a forked digital asset protocol.<br /></li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>User Feedback and Ideas
          <ol type="a">
            <li>User Feedback and Ideas. You may choose to or we may invite you to submit feedback, ideas, modifications, comments, or suggestions about the Service or Vultisig generally, including about how to improve the Service or our products (each, an “Idea”). By submitting any Idea, you acknowledge that and hereby consent to your disclosure being gratuitous, unsolicited and without restriction and will not place Vultisig under any fiduciary or other obligation, and that Vultisig is the sole owner of such Idea and that we are free to use any Idea without any additional compensation to you, or to disclose the Ideas on a non-confidential basis or otherwise to anyone. You acknowledge that, despite our acceptance of your Idea submission, Vultisig does not waive any rights to use similar or related ideas previously known to Vultisig, or developed by its employees or contractors, or obtained from sources other than you.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>The Vultisig App
          <ol type="a">
            <li><p>Generally. To use the App, you must have a mobile device that is compatible with the App. Vultisig does not warrant and/or guarantee that the App will be compatible with your mobile device. You may be required by your wireless provider to use mobile data in connection with the App and may incur additional charges from your wireless provider for using this data. You acknowledge that you are solely responsible for any such charges and Vultisig will have no liability for such charges. Vultisig hereby grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use a compiled code copy of the App for one mobile device owned or leased solely by you for your personal use (“App License”). The App License is not a sale of the App or any copy of the App, and Vultisig or its third-party partners or suppliers retain all rights, title, and interest in the App (and any copy of the App). Any attempt by you to transfer any of the rights, duties, or obligations in connection with the App License, except as expressly provided for in these Terms, is void and of no legal effect. You acknowledge that Vultisig may release future versions of the App, which may be automatically downloaded to your mobile device and replace a prior version of the App. You consent to such automatic upgrading on your mobile device and acknowledge that these Terms will apply to all such upgrades. Any third-party code that may be incorporated in the App is covered by the applicable open source or third-party license end-user license agreement, if any, authorizing use of such code. Vultisig reserves all rights in the App not expressly granted under these Terms.</p></li>
            <li>Additional Apple App Store Terms. This section applies to all Users who obtain the App from Apple's App Store. You and Vultisig acknowledge that: (i) these Terms are solely between you and Vultisig; (ii) Apple, Inc. and its affiliates or subsidiaries (“Apple”) are not a party to these Terms; and (iii) Apple has no responsibility for the App or its related content. Your use of the App must comply with the applicable Apple’s App Store terms of service or use. If a conflict arises between Apple’s App Store terms and these Terms, then Apple’s App Store terms of service or use will prevail. The App License is limited to use on Apple-branded Products that you own or control and as permitted by the Usage Rules set forth in the App Store Terms of Service, except that the App may be accessed and used by other Accounts associated with you via “Family Sharing” or volume purchasing. You and Vultisig acknowledge that Apple has no obligation to provide you with any maintenance and support services with respect to the App. Vultisig is solely responsible for any product warranties of the App, whether expressed or implied by law, to the extent not effectively disclaimed elsewhere in these Terms. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Apple will have no other warranty obligation with respect to the App, and any other claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs, or expenses attributable to any failure to conform to any warranty will be solely Vultisig’s responsibility. You acknowledge that Apple is not responsible for addressing any claims of you or any third-party relating to the App and your possession or use of the App, including: (iv) product liability claims; (v) any claim that the App fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; and (vi) claims arising under consumer protection, privacy, or similar legislation. You and Vultisig acknowledge that, if any third-party claim that the App or your possession and use of the App infringes that third-party’s intellectual property rights, Vultisig, not Apple, will be solely responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement, and discharge of any such intellectual property infringement claim to the extent required by these Terms. You shall comply with any applicable third-party terms of agreement when using the App. You and Vultisig acknowledge that Apple is a third-party beneficiary of these Terms as relates to your license of the App, and that, upon your acceptance of these Terms, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms as relates to your license of the App against you as a third-party beneficiary of these Terms.</li>
            <li>Google Play Store Terms. If you downloaded the App from Google's Play Store and a conflict arises between Google's Play Store terms and these Terms, then you acknowledge that Google's Play Store terms will prevail.</li>
            <li>Service Rules. You shall not engage in any of the following (each, a “Prohibited Activity”): (i) modifying, disassembling, decompiling, or reverse engineering any portion of the Service (except if and to the extent permitted by applicable mandatory law); (ii) renting, leasing, loaning, reselling, sublicensing, or otherwise transferring any portion of the Service to any third-party; (iii) use any portion of the Service to provide time sharing or similar services for any third-party; (iv) copying, distributing, or disclosing any part of the Service in any medium, including by any automated or non-automated “scraping”; (v) writing, using any automated system, including “robots,” “spiders,” “offline readers,” etc., to access the Service in a manner that sends more request messages to the Vultisig servers than a human can reasonably produce in the same period of time by using a conventional on-line web browser (except that Vultisig grants the operators of public search engines revocable permission to use spiders to copy publicly available materials from the Websites for the sole purpose of and solely to the extent necessary for creating publicly available searchable indices of those materials, but not caches or archives of such materials); (vi) transmitting spam, chain letters, or other unsolicited email in connection with the Service; (vii) attempting to interfere with, compromise the system integrity or security or decipher any transmissions to or from the servers running the Service; (viii) taking any action that imposes, or may impose at our sole discretion an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on our infrastructure; (ix) uploading invalid data, viruses, worms, or other software agents through the Service; (x) collecting or harvesting any personally identifiable information from the Service; (xi) using the Service for any commercial solicitation purposes; (xii) impersonating another person or otherwise misrepresenting your affiliation with a person or entity, conducting fraud, hiding or attempting to hide your identity in connection with the Service, including using a temporary email account; (xiii) interfering with the proper working of the Service; (xiv) accessing any content on the Service through any technology or means other than those provided or authorized by the Service; (xv) bypassing the measures we may use to prevent or restrict access to the Service, including removing, circumventing, disabling or otherwise interfering with security-related features or features that prevent or restrict use or copying of any content or enforce limitations on use of the Service or the content of the Service; or (xvi) deleting any of our copyright and other proprietary rights notices.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Our Proprietary Rights
          <p>Subject to article IV, the Service, and all materials contained in the Service or transferred to or from the Service, including software, images, text, graphics, illustrations, logos, and content belonging to other Users (“Vultisig Content”), are available under an open-source license and can be accessed and forked on GitHub. While Vultisig and its licensors retain certain Intellectual Property Rights, the open-source nature of the software allows you to modify, distribute, and create derivative works in accordance with the terms of the applicable open-source license. You are encouraged to review the specific open-source license terms on our GitHub repository to understand your rights and responsibilities. Vultisig is not liable for any altered code or products that someone else may publish or distribute. Use of the Vultisig Content for any purpose not expressly permitted by these Terms or the applicable open-source license is prohibited.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Privacy &amp; Security
          <p>Vultisig respects the privacy of its Users and will not request any information beyond what is necessary for the use of the Service or to comply with our obligations under applicable law. Vultisig also does not obscure the blockchain information that it does request or obtain. You acknowledge that due to the inherent transparent nature of blockchains, Transactions are public and easily correlated. Attempting to utilize Vultisig to obscure Transactions or assets will be pointless and ineffective, and is ill-advised. Law enforcement has full access to blockchain information that goes in or out of Vultisig's system. You acknowledge that Vultisig will comply willingly with all valid legal requests for information. We reserve the right to provide information to law enforcement personnel and other third-parties to answer inquiries, participate in investigations, respond to legal process, respond to the order of a court of competent jurisdiction and those exercising the court’s authority, and to protect Vultisig and our Users.</p>
          <p>Processing of your personal data by Vultisig is governed by our Privacy Policy.</p>
          <p>Vultisig cares about the integrity and security of your personal data, and stores all personal data provided by Users in an encrypted fashion. However, we cannot warrant and/or guarantee that unauthorized third-parties will never be able to defeat our security measures or use your personal data for improper purposes.</p>
        </li>
        <li>No Refunds and Cross-Chain Transactions.
          <ol type="a">
            <li>Unsupported Digital Assets. Any digital assets that we do not support that are sent to unrelated or inaccurate wallets through the Service cannot be extracted or returned.</li>
            <li><p>Cross-Chain Recovery Program. Please use extreme caution when sending digital assets to Vultisig or the Service and make sure to confirm that you are sending the correct type of digital asset to the correct address. A transfer of digital assets to Vultisig that is mistakenly sent to an address of a different digital asset is a “Cross Chain Transaction”. Recovery of Cross-Chain Transactions is a risky and time-consuming process. The level of complexity and risk depends both on the type of digital asset and the address used for the Transaction. Not all Cross-Chain Transactions are recoverable, and digital assets sent to the wrong address are at risk of recovery by bad actors not associated with Vultisig.</p><p>Vultisig IS NOT RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE FOR ANY CROSS-CHAIN TRANSACTIONS INITIATED BY YOU OR ANY OTHER USER. If you request assistance in recovering a Cross Chain Transaction, Vultisig may decide in its sole discretion whether to assist or attempt to recover such Cross-Chain Transaction. There is no time limit for any such discretionary recovery attempts and Vultisig will not be liable for a failed recovery of any Cross-Chain Transaction. If any such recovery is attempted, Vultisig may assess you with a fee, communicated to you in advance, that reflects the level of effort and developer time consumed on the amount or value of the digital asset. You acknowledge and consent to the assessment of this fee when making any such recovery request.</p><p>If you would like to ask Vultisig to attempt to recover your digital assets from a Cross-Chain Transaction that you initiated, please reach out to our support team with the details of the Transaction by emailing our customer support info@vultisig.com. Vultisig will evaluate your request and determine in its sole discretion whether to initiate recovery procedures. You acknowledge that even if Vultisig decides to attempt a Cross-Chain Transaction recovery on your behalf, we make no warranty and/or guarantee that any such attempted recovery will ultimately be successful.</p></li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>VULT Tokens
          <ol type="a">
            <li>VULT Token Basics. The VULT token is a digital asset that Vultisig may issue in the future. It is intended to be a standard ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain, accessible through most wallets that support Ethereum. Vultisig plans to use VULT tokens to provide loyalty benefits in connection with a User’s use of the Service, such as enhanced features. Vultisig may change, add, or remove any benefits associated with VULT tokens at any time, in its sole discretion. Each User’s VULT token balance will be displayed in Vultisig.</li>
            <li>How to Obtain VULT Tokens. Vultisig does not presently sell VULT tokens. In the future, Vultisig may distribute VULT tokens to verified Users in various amounts based on promotions or for completing certain actions, such as referring a new User to the App or trying new features and providing feedback. Users may receive different amounts of VULT tokens for completing the same actions, and Vultisig retains sole discretion in determining whether a User will receive VULT tokens and how many will be allocated based on the details of each offering or promotion. By entering an Ethereum address for Vultisig to send any applicable VULT tokens to, you represent that you control that Ethereum address.</li>
            <li>The `VULT COMMUNITY` Program. For a limited time, Vultisig may distribute VULT tokens to Users who perform certain activities on the App. The amount of VULT tokens awarded through this program will be specified in the associated promotional materials or displayed on the Service before you initiate a qualifying Transaction. Transactions that include an asset without sufficient price discovery information may not qualify for this program.</li>
            <li>The “Staking” Program. The staking program is a planned feature that is not currently available. In the future, users may be able to lock up their VULT tokens in an Ethereum-based smart contract. Depending on the amount staked, more loyalty benefits, such as extra premium features, could be unlocked. Users would be able to withdraw their locked-up VULT tokens anytime with no time restriction. Once withdrawn, users would lose the loyalty benefits. Vultisig would not have access to the locked-up VULT and would not be a custodian of the locked-up VULT. The smart contract would hold the VULT, and only the Ethereum address that staked the VULT could withdraw it. Vultisig would provide the staking program `as is` without making any guarantees or assuming liability for the functionality of the smart contract. Users are advised to acknowledge and understand the associated risks.</li>
            <li>The “Cashback” or “Discount” Program. The cashback or discount program is a planned feature that is not currently available. In the future, users participating in the staking program for loyalty benefits may be identified to participate in the cashback or discount program. A part of the transaction fees paid for the usage of certain blockchains for cross-chain transactions may be redirected to the VULT staking smart contract. Users of the staking program could claim their share of cashback or discount in USDC. The calculation and distribution of cashback would be handled by the respective blockchain. Vultisig would not hold custody of the cashback or discount USDC at any time and would not be responsible for any aspect of the “Cashback” or “Discount” Program. Users acknowledge and agree that their relationship regarding this service would be with the respective blockchain, subject to its terms and conditions.</li>
            <li>No Resale Value. VULT tokens are solely provided to create a loyalty program for Users. VULT tokens are not intended to be an investment, and there is no expectation that VULT tokens will ever have liquidity, any measurable value, or appreciate in value. Vultisig will not advocate or promote the resale of VULT tokens to any other person or support the creation of any benefits in the secondary market for VULT tokens.</li>
            <li>Legal Risks. You acknowledge that current or future regulations could make Vultisig or VULT tokens illegal in some jurisdictions or for some categories of Users, which could result in the winding down of Vultisig, the Service, or VULT tokens, or a decrease in their value. Because VULT tokens have not been formally classified by or registered with any regulatory agency, subsequent determinations by any regulator may prevent certain persons from using or holding VULT tokens in the future or cause the functionality, access to, or demand for the VULT tokens to be reduced materially.</li>
            <li>Your Additional Acknowledgments. By redeeming, earning, receiving, or holding a VULT token, you acknowledge that:
              <ol type="i">
                <li>VULT tokens are not an investment, and you have no expectation of economic benefit or profit (other than the benefits of specific Vultisig loyalty programs);</li>
